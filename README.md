## *Idea 1*
## Title : Intelligent Attendance and In-time tracker
Description : Tracking and logging movement of people can be a very cumbersome yet crucial task for an organisation whose bottom line depends on the man hours and screentime of its workforce. Our aim is to provide a one stop solution to this by using facial recognition algorithm to keep a log of employees entering and leaving the workspaces.This powerful yet simple tool will enable organisations to keep a check on number and details of attendees in various events and thus help them predict requirement of seats for upcoming events.The same product can be used by educational institutions to keep attendance logs of its students.

Solution : Use of Face Recognition softwares Open face , IBM watson  and Sensifi
## *Idea 2*
## Title : Competitive price finder and predictor

Problem: 

1. Sometimes people think of buying a product but itâ€™s not very urgent and can wait (either until it becomes a necessity or until it gets cheaper). But for that, they need to check the websites everyday to figure out when the product is cheapest.
2. While shopping from supermarkets like Target and Walmart or web retailers like Amazon, we tend to search a product everywhere possible to check where that product is available for the cheapest price. But this search takes a lot of time and effort as we need to scan through websites of each retailer separately.

Solution: 

1. A web based platform where one can search a product and get results based on detailed analysis about where the product is cheapest out of multiple store and web based retailers.
2. Predict the future prices of products based on previous price fluctuations and market trends. Users can keep particular products under watch (shortlist to get future price predictions) and the system will notify users about major price fluctuations.
3. Scrape the internet to find trending keywords about the product and predict the sentiment.

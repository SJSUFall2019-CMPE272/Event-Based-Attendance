# ABSTRACT : 

Organizers of all large Conventions,Conferences and Trade Shows face the perennial problem of tracking the movement of people inside an event centre for extracting some meaningful insight from it. On the other hand the attendees face the issue of not being informed in real time about the event that is running in a given room on a given location inside the centre .Our motive is to provide a one stop solution to this with an innovative application of RFID devices which will be strategically placed throughout the event centre capturing and tracking each attendeeâ€™s activities, The system will generate marketing leads for each stall and speaker ,giving details about how many people spent how much time on a specific stall or a seminar thereby revealing a list of people who are most probable prospective customers for a vendor who hosted a stall/seminar at the convention centre.Attendees will be able to login to the application and signup with their LinkedIn account to get real time details about the people from their connection list who are present in the same room of the event centre and get notifications with details of event centre rooms as they walk through the event centre.



Technology : Use of Face Recognition softwares Open face , IBM watson  and Sensifi

## Title : Intelligent Attendance and In-time tracker
Description : 

Tracking and logging movement of people can be a very cumbersome yet crucial task for an organisation whose bottom line depends on the man hours and screentime of its workforce. Our aim is to provide a one stop solution to this by using facial recognition algorithm to keep a log of employees entering and leaving the workspaces.This powerful yet simple tool will enable organisations to keep a check on number and details of attendees in various events and thus help them predict requirement of seats for upcoming events.The same product can be used by educational institutions to keep attendance logs of its students.

Technology : Use of Face Recognition softwares Open face , IBM watson  and Sensifi
